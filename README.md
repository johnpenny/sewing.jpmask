A mask pattern based on HK Mask https://diymask.site

### Why Did You Make It?
This is a version of the HK Mask pattern that is normalised over three sizes and includes complex tabs to make sewing easier and more consistent. It trades off a more complex cut with an easier to sew pattern; which I found to be the best option when making many masks. The cut can also be done by machine.

I created this in March 2020 to solve my frustrations with the HK Mask pattern.

I also added some tweaks to the process and the sewing methods, which I may write up at a later date.
